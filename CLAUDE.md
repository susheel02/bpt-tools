#### Structure Design Rationale

**Distributed Modular Approach Benefits:**
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each tool is self-contained with its own assets and logic
- **Modular Development**: Developers can work on individual tools without affecting others
- **Easy Tool Management**: Adding, removing, or archiving tools is straightforward
- **Independent Deployment**: Individual tools can be deployed or updated separately
- **Reduced Naming Conflicts**: Tool-specific files can use similar names without collision
- **Scalable Architecture**: New tools can be added without restructuring existing ones

**File Organization Principles:**
- **Root-level folders**: Contain only truly shared resources used by 3+ tools
- **Tool-specific folders**: Maintain independence with their own assets/ and includes/
- **Clear Boundaries**: Shared vs. tool-specific resources are easily identifiable
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Developers can quickly locate tool-specific vs. shared files

### Shared Components
- **Header/Footer**: Consistent BeyondPhotoTips.com branding
- **Styling**: Shared CSS with tool-specific overrides
- **Security**: .htaccess protection for all directories
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics integration
- **SEO**: Optimized meta descriptions and structured navigation

### Development Standards
- **CSS Versioning**: Cache-busting with version numbers (current: v0.0.3)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: WCAG guidelines compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and caching
- **Security**: Input validation, XSS protection, secure headers

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- **Environment**: MAMP with PHP 8.3
- **Access**: http://localhost/dof-calc/ (or your local path)
- **Testing**: Cross-browser testing on mobile and desktop

### Deployment
- **Production**: PHP VPS server
- **Security**: .htaccess configurations for protection
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracking (G-ZZXPCE599N)

### Version Control
- **Repository**: Git with descriptive commit messages
- **Branching**: Main branch for stable releases
- **Documentation**: This CLAUDE.md file and individual tool documentation

## Calculator Development Guidelines

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Clear labels, logical flow
2. **Educational Value**: Explain concepts, not just calculate
3. **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly controls
4. **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators, real-time updates
5. **Save/Bookmark**: Allow users to save calculations

### Code Organization
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic in PHP, presentation in HTML/CSS
2. **Reusable Components**: Shared functions and styling for input elements and overall page structure
3. **Input Validation**: Both client and server-side
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with helpful messages
5. **Performance**: Efficient calculations and minimal resources

### File Organization Guidelines

#### Shared vs. Tool-Specific Decision Matrix

**Move to shared/ when:**
- Used by 3+ tools
- Core functionality (authentication, validation, utilities)
- Brand assets (logos, common UI components)
- Performance critical (can be cached globally)

**Keep in tool-specific folders when:**
- Unique to one tool
- Tool-specific configurations
- Domain-specific calculations
- Tool-specific UI styling

#### File Naming Conventions
- **Shared assets**: Use generic names (`tools.css`, `common.js`)
- **Tool-specific assets**: Use descriptive names that indicate the tool
  - `/dof-calculator/assets/css/style.css` (clear context from path)
  - `/dof-calculator/assets/js/app.js` (main application file)
  - `/print-size-calculator/assets/css/print-calculator.css` (descriptive name)

#### Development Workflow Benefits
1. **New Tool Creation**: Simply copy an existing tool folder structure
2. **Asset Management**: Clear path resolution (`../assets/css/tools.css` for shared, `assets/css/style.css` for local)
3. **Code Maintenance**: Changes are scoped to specific tools unless intentionally shared
4. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different tools without conflicts

### Feature Requirements
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Sliders, dropdowns, text inputs
- **Real-time Calculations**: Update as user types/selects
- **Educational Content**: Tooltips, help text, explanations
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual feedback on calculation quality
- **Export Options**: Save, print, or share results

## Future Enhancements
- Additional specialized calculators based on user feedback
- Advanced features for professional photographers
- Integration with camera databases (when appropriate)
- Educational content and tutorials
- Community features (user submissions, favorites)

## Maintenance Notes
- **CSS Versioning**: Increment version numbers when updating styles
- **Security Updates**: Regular .htaccess and PHP security reviews  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track loading times and user engagement
- **User Feedback**: Collect and implement user suggestions
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test with major browsers and devices
